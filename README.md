#Breakthrough ANN
##### Deep neural networks for use in an agent utilizing a Monte Carlo tree search in the game of Breakthrough. 
Can also be used as a standalone player (via ['breakthrough_player.py'](../master/Breakthrough_Player/breakthrough_player.py)). <p>
Multiple auxiliary files for pulling the data from a website storing Breakthrough game data, or self-play logs, and transforming that data into labeled training data for a neural network built using Tensorflow.
<p><p>Currently running experiments on different models trained on self-play data.
<p>(Ignore older files as they need to be cleaned up and collated)
