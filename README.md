#Breakthrough ANN
##### A Deep Neural Network for evaluating board positions in the game of Breakthrough. 
Constructing neural networks for use in an agent utilizing a Monte Carlo tree search. 
Multiple auxiliary files for pulling the data from a website storing Breakthrough game data or self-play logs, and transforming that data into labeled training data for a neural network built using Tensorflow.
<p><p>Currently running experiments on different models trained on self-play data.
